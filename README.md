Carabiners
==========

A bunch of small [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) build tasks, ready to be snapped together to build your projects!

## Note
This is early days and this project isn't ready for use yet.

It is intended to eventually take over from [Carabiner](https://github.com/dvmtn/carabiner), the current Developer Mountain JS build setup.

[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and [Grunt-source](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-source) have been fun, but the style of Gulp makes build scripts easier to handle.
Carabiners is intended to be a library of Gulp tasks to help quickly assemble a build script for your Javascript projects.
